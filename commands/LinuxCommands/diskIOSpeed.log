# display IO speed per process
# iotop watches I/O usage information output by the Linux kernel and displays a table of current I/O usage by processes or threads on the system.
# It displays the I/O bandwidth read and written by each process/thread. It also displays the percentage of time the thread/process spent 
# while swapping in and while waiting on I/O.

# Total DISK READ and Total DISK WRITE values represent total read and write bandwidth between processes and kernel threads on the one side 
# and kernel block device subsystem on the other.

# Actual DISK READ and Actual DISK WRITE values represent corresponding bandwidths for actual disk I/O between kernel block device subsystem 
# and underlying hardware (HDD, SSD, etc.).
sudo iotop

# If you would like to check which process are actually doing IO then run the iotop command with -o or --only option
sudo iotop -o

# Run the nfsiostat command to see the I/O statistics for Network File System(NFS)
nfsiostat

# Run the iostat command with -d option to see I/O statistics for all the devices
iostat -d 1 5

# Show IO speed per partition
iostat -d -p 1 5
